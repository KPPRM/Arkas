# Arkas

Arkas Was created by CoriW on the KSP forums and was maintained for a time under TheWhiteGuardian.

				Installing the mod itself
These Instructions only apply to releases and not the master branch.
1. In the download, go into the 'Files' folder, then into the folder named 'Mod'
2. In this 'Mod' folder, you will find a folder named 'Arkas'. Got it? Okay.
3. Next, you need to locate your KSP directory, the folder with the KSP.exe file in it. Found the folder? Great! Make sure to memorize the location of this folder as we're going to need it a lot.

4. Alright, so now that you have your KSP directory open, go into the GameData folder. Next, in the 'Mod' folder included in the download, you want to copy the 'Arkas' folder and paste it INSIDE the 'GameData' folder. Got it?
So the filepath should be KSPDirectory/GameData/Arkas.
Note that you need to install Kopernicus first in order for the planet to load.



From now on everything is optional, only follow these steps if you want those mods to run.

				PlanetShine & Distant Object Enhancement
PlanetShine & DOE support is enabled by default, just download and install the PS and/or DOE Plugin(s) and you should be good to go. This counts for both Arkas and any moon you may want to add.



				Custom normal maps
Is the normal resolution too demanding, or do you want even more eyecandy? No problem!
1. In the download, go into the 'Files' folder, then the 'Normals' folder.
'HiResArkas' = 8K normal map (8192 by 4096 pixels)
'MedResArkas' = 4K normal map (4096 by 2048 pixels) this one is installed by default, but bundled here nevertheless for backup purposes.
'LowResArkas' = 2K normal map (2048 by 1024 pixels)
2. Go into the folder with the resolution you want. Inside, you should find a file called Arkas_Normal.png.
3. In your KSP directory, go to 'GameData/Arkas/PluginData' and replace the Arkas_Normal.png file inside this 'PluginData' folder with the custom normal map inside the download.



				Clouds & Sandstorms (Environmental Visual Enhancements)
1. In the download, go into the 'Files' folder, then the 'EVE' folder.
2. Next, in your KSP directory, go into the 'GameData' folder, then the 'Arkas' folder, then the folder named 'Expansions'. There should be a folder named 'Cache' inside, do NOT delete this folder or go inside this folder. Stay inside the Expansions folder.
3. Then, in the download, in the 'EVE' folder, take a look at the three folders. Here's what they mean:
'EVE_HiRes' = 8K cloudmap (8192 by 4096 pixels)
'EVE_MedRes'= 4K cloudmap (4096 by 2048 pixels)
'EVE_LowRes'= 2K cloudmap (2048 by 1024 pixels)
4. Pick the folder with the cloud resolution you want and place it inside the 'GameData/Arkas/Expansions' folder. Read: DIRECTLY INSIDE THE EXPANSIONS FOLDER.
Note that the EVE resolutions are not compatible with each other. If you want to change the resolution, delete the old folder first!
Also, this uses textures from EVE itself, thus aside from the plugin, you need the configs & textures download as well.

VERY IMPORTANT! If you do not install Kras, go inside the EVE_Res folder you just copied into GameData/Arkas/Expansions and delete EVE_Kras_XX, XX changes depending on what resolution you have installed.

				Moons
1. In the download, go into the 'Files' folder, then the 'Moons' folder.
2. In your KSP directory, go to 'GameData/Arkas/Expansions'
3. In the download, copy the folders of the moons you want to install and paste them into the 'Expansions' folder.

Alright, that should do it! Have fun exploring!
